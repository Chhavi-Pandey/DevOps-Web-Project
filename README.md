## Introduction
This project is used for an introduction to creating and deploying a Java-based web app using AWS especially their CI/CD tools.

## Technologies
Here's what I'm using for this project -
- **Amazon EC2**: I'm developing my web app on Amazon EC2 virtual servers, so that software development and deployment happens entirely on cloud.
- **VSCode**:
